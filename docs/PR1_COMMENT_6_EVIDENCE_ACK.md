## ⚠️ Missing: Drift Report Details

**Issue:** Preflight output references `reports/spec-openapi-ddl-drift.md` but the exact **mismatch count** was not quoted.

**Required:** Please paste the **first 10 lines** of `reports/spec-openapi-ddl-drift.md` OR provide a one-line summary with the mismatch count.

**Critical:** We must see **drift = 0** explicitly before proceeding with final approval.

**Example of what I'm looking for:**
```
OpenAPI ↔ DDL Drift Report
Generated: 2025-10-25
Mismatches: 0
```

OR

```
Drift check: 0 mismatches found
```

**Please post the drift details** and I'll proceed with the 7-phase review deliverables.
